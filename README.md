## Team

- Mouhamad K. Hotait (team leader)

Students offer tutoring or open study sessions for specific courses, and other students join them.

- **Sessions:** tutoring or study-group sessions for a course
- **Courses:** university courses the sessions are about
- **Tutors / Users:** students who host or join sessions (a tutor is a user who hosts sessions)

## Pages and Contributions

| Member | Pages | Branch |
|---|---|---|
| Hotait | Homepage, Session List | `feature/home-session-list` |
| Jaafar | Session Details, Tutor Profile | `feature/details-tutor-profile` |
| Moubarak | Create/Edit Session, My Sessions | `feature/session-form-dashboard` |
| Yazbek | Login, Register | `feature/login-register` |

Hotait also built the project setup, routing, navbar, theme toggle, mock data, data contexts, shared components, and deployment.

## How Mock Data Works

There is no backend in Phase 1. All data starts in `src/data/mockData.js` (courses, users, sessions). Two React contexts load this data into state and share it with every page:

- `SessionsContext`: create, edit, delete, join, and leave sessions
- `AuthContext`: login, register, logout, and the current user

Changes appear immediately across the app but reset when the page is refreshed. In Phase 2, these context functions will call the backend instead.

## Team Rules

- Never push to `main`. Work on your branch and open a pull request; the leader reviews and merges.
- Only edit your own page files and components you create. Ask the leader before changing shared files (`App.jsx`, `Navbar`, `context/`, `data/`, `index.css`).
- Pages never import `mockData.js` directly: use `useSessions()` and `useAuth()`.
- Use the shared `Button` and `Input` components and the theme colors (`brand-...`, `accent-...`).
- Mobile-first: phone styles first, then `md:` and `lg:`. Add `dark:` classes. Test on phone, iPad, and laptop sizes before a pull request.
- Every input has a label, every image has alt text.
- Small commits with clear messages.
